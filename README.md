# BadgeELF API
This component provides the API used by BadgeELF applets ([template](https://github.com/badgeteam/badge-elf-template); [loader](https://github.com/badgeteam/esp32-component-badge-elf)).
It can also be used standalone for anyone wishing to port a BadgeELF applet back into being a firmware.
